## STPatternLearning

STPatternLearning is a deep learning framework for analyzing real-time 3D mammalian embryo and organ development. By converting 3D volumes into structured 2D images, this approach enables precise developmental feature matching across embryos, offering insights into intrinsic morphogenetic patterns during gastrulation and early organogenesis.

## Features

- 2D embryo image matching: Enable accurate matching of 2D images derived from 3D embryo volumes.
- 3D embryo matching: Extend feature matching to 3D embryo datasets for holistic developmental analysis.

## In the repository

- `codes/models` contains the script for training Siamese Swin Transformer
- `codes/utils/` contains helper scripts for model training
